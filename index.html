          Its the story in Spongebob Squarepants which is an anthropomorphic sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea in the idyllic town of Bikini Bottom. He lives next door to Patrick, a star-fish who is sweet but dumb as the rock he lives under and Squidward, an octopus who is consistently annoyed by Spongebob and Patrick's antics.
